## Tomato Harvest Tracker Setup Summary

We've created a complete tracking system for your tomato harvest. Here's what we've accomplished:

1. **Google Sheet**: Created "Tomato Harvest Tracker" Sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fukctm2sh8TekisGromdCbFpKYeGzOVq1aIyG8NbdZE/)
   - This will store all your harvest data

2. **Google Apps Script**: Set up a web app deployed as:
   - URL: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwvg9pV912Ip0U41rUftcE-eJ_8Bh_CgLqt-SnmxLd_5bd4Tm7_RHLQHUmkoe1Kx7wl/exec
   - Access: Set to "Anyone" so both you and Ryan can use it
   - Functions: Created handlers for data submission

3. **HTML Form**: Created a mobile-friendly web form with:
   - User selection (you or Ryan)
   - Typeahead dropdown for tomato varieties
   - Dynamic rows that add as you enter data
   - Submit functionality

## Important Next Steps

For the form to work properly, you'll need to update the Google Apps Script with the proper code. Here's what to do:

1. Go to https://script.google.com/u/0/home/projects/1UCDKM74NNsHKQX4fvbWWKOosNA5m-jPdoStQzaJA4R0V2XrQu-LHxAiN/edit
2. Replace all the code in Code.gs with the contents of the google-apps-script.js file we created
3. Save the project
4. Deploy again (Deploy > New Deployment > Web App > Anyone > Deploy)

Once this is done, the form should work correctly!

## Deployment Options

Since we're hitting a CORS error when testing locally, here are your options for using the form:

1. **Simplest**: Upload the HTML file to a web server that allows CORS
2. **Google Sites**: Create a Google Site and embed the HTML form
3. **Github Pages**: Host the form for free on Github Pages
4. **Local Testing**: Use a browser with CORS disabled just for testing (not recommended for regular use)

Let me know if you'd like me to help with any of these deployment options!
